      Beautiful frescos of people working alongside dinosaurs to build skyscrapers
      decorate this room.
      The dinosaurs are used like cranes, diggers, and elevators.
      The frescos are descecrated, saying "I, the great Kraken, claim these lands 
      for the waters. None shall build here again without my leave."
      There might be treasure here: tell a GM the codephrase 'Godzilla's Bones'.
