      Beautiful frescos of people working alongside dinosaurs to build skyscrapers
      decorate this room.
      The dinosaurs are used like cranes, diggers, and elevators.
      The frescos are descecrated, covered with Graffiti saying "I, the great Kraken, claim these lands 
      for the waters. None shall build here again without my leave."
      There might be treasure here: tell a GM the codephrase 'Godzilla's Bones'.

      You use an active ingredient in the coconut rum to cure the dance of the phoenix.
      To make the cure work, you'll need an industrial base to mass produce it,
      some research into how to refine the cure, and you'll need to be able to
      select the coconut rum out from among the normal rum.
