            You find an underwater temple complex, obviously devoted to the
            worship of forgotten gods. There is cuneiform writing carved into the rocks, that you can just make out through your diving helmet. Stragely, you find you understand it. It's talking about four ancient tribes who worshipped four Old Gods. Some of it is covered in barnacles, but you can just make out something about the beautiful sunfolk who lived in a flaming mountain, the Menki mountain giants, and the deep ones in the ocean. You see carvings of a giant lizard,
            a flaming bird, a huge squid, and a massive ape. Who are these
            ancient deities?

            black graffiti. You'll need to excavate carefully if you want to learn more. It'll be a big operation, and you'll require significant
            resources.

            decorate this room. Cuneiform markings state that this is the
            tomb of Godzilla.
            The dinosaurs are used like cranes, diggers, and elevators.
